Linux Networking Basics

In order to have connectivity between two machines
(Basic Network Checklist)
1.  O.S
2.  NIC
3.  IPv4
4.  IP of A&B are in the same network
5.  Physical Connectivity
6.  IP - Private    NAT
         Public

What is Network Name ?
Eg 192.168.2.57

1-126       Class A     First Octet for Network Name
128-191     Class B     Till Second Octet for Network Name
192-223     Class C     Till Third  Octet for Network Name
224-255     Class D     Till Fourth Octet for Network Name

############  In Practical world Network name "CANNOT BE FOUND" using the Class Name  ############

This is theortical knowledge
Netmask is the only way, we can find the network name.
For Eg:  inet 192.168.0.113  netmask 255.255.255.0

Why we require network name?
A - 192.168.1.2     255.255.0.0
B - 192.168.5.2     255.255.0.0
Network name is same hence we can use the Switch

A - 192.168.1.2     255.255.255.0
B - 192.168.5.2     255.255.0.0
Network name is different hence we can use the Router

192.168.1.2
255.255.255.0

IP - 11000000 ------------
NM - 11111111 ------------
Logical AND Operation
NN- 11000000 ------------
In Decimal -> 192.168.1.0 is the Network Name (NN)


route -n

169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 wlp2s0
172.17.0.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     0      0        0 docker0
192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     600    0        0 wlp2s0

Router is also sometimes known as Gateway, as it takes you to the outside world.


Any system that has internet connectivity
they have routing table

route del -net 0.0.0.0
will break the connectivity
As, we deleted the gateway. And it takes us to the outside world.


route add -net 0.0.0.0 gw {IP of the Modem/Router}
It will add the entry and tells the system about "Default Gateway"



Configure network

Manually -->    ifconfig enp0s .2.3.4 netmask 255.255.0.0
                route add -net 0.0.0.0 gw 1.2.3.100

Automatically  -->  Dynamic
                    DHCP Server
                    We take the IP from the DHCP Server, by default Hotspot( works as switch,modem,router) has the DHCP Server.
