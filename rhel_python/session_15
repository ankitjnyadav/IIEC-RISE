Webservers uses protocol HTTP

A server can also act as client, as server resides in the same system

curl http://192.168.255.255/myFileName.html

Port no: It is just unique ID of server

ps -aux -> all the programs/processes running in the os
netstat ->
netstat -tnlp

Webserver port no :80
Then actually URL --> http://192.168.255.255:80/myFileName.html

Change the port no. for webserver
When we change something in config file we restart
